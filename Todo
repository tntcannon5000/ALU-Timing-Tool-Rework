Minimise dependencies by removing easyocr for a faster alternative that does not need all of pytorch, or find a way to only bundle minimal pytorch  libraries
Attempt teleportation in ALU by using memory manipulation packages and the script
Implement data analytics by capturing the speedometer every frame, to then log acceleration to a graph as an optional add-on to the UI
Implement save splicing and merging automatically in a 3rd mode called "splits" - autosaves PB splits, merges them into spliced ghost, and saves PB ghost as well (but prompts user as usual)
Add additional optional UI during the race to show comparison to splits and also an option to race against "best possible time" ghost instead (and also configuration of "checkpoints" in the menu)
Make a built-in function to convert ghosts from Bholla's file format to the JSON format, runs automatically if it detects a Bholla save file has been selected
Detection system: run % change detection --> found % change --> start clock --> read % with CNN --> run detection on igt --> found time change --> stop clock --> read timer with CNN --> save % time as CNN_time - clock_delta
(for above, "read % with CNN" can be moved to after "stop clock" for slightly more reliable performance)
